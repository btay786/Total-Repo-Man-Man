# Total-Repo-Man-Man
module 1 baby!  oh boy.
Goals for first Project:
as a student i'm hoping to change and edit and leave the code tighter and better and follow the user story as well as the acceptance criteria.

##USER STORY:

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

###ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:

"GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title"

#### Description:
I had wonderful and fun experience filled with roller coaster emotions coming to grips with taking the given code and reviewing the semnatic HTML elements.  I enjoyed concising them down into different sections and division, as well has enjoed giving unique id attribues to be used in css. then i ordered it all, and made it beautfiul, i rock, you rock, we all rock....have a wonderful day! and tHank you.
